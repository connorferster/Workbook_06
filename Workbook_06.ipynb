    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Now that you have your `.cti` data in your data type, you can manipulate it relatively easily. For example, you could change all of the factored loads by changing the values in the list of lists that represent the factored loads in your data type.\n",

    "Design a function that takes two parameters, a `list[list[float]]` representing a factored load (Axial, Mx, My) and a `CTIFile` dictionary. **Your function will either return `None` -OR- it will return a new `CTIFile` dictionary (see \"Important thing to consider\", below).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: From trial and error (and/or reading the CTI file documentation at: https://structurepoint.org/spColumn-Online-Manual/spColumn/Appendix/spColumn_Text_Input_CTI_file_format.htm), you will find that to update the factored loads (and have them be recognized by spColumn), you need to update three pieces of information.\n",

    "1. In the `'[Factored Loads]'` section, you have to put in the new loads.\n",
    "2. At the top of the `'[Factored Loads]'` section, there is an integer representing the count of the number of factored loads in the file.\n",
    "3. In the `'[User Options]'` section, there is a single line of numbers in a list. These numbers have various meanings you can read about in the documentation. The number in the 18th position (if counting from 1) is an integer representing the count of the number of factored loads in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "To update the factored loads, you must update **all three values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important thing to consider:** In a previous lesson, I explained that some Python data types are _mutable_ and some are _immutable_. Both the `dict` and the `list` are _mutable_ so when you update the CTIFile dictionary, it will change the dictionary that exists outside of the function, even if you do not `return` it. This means that if you try changing your factored loads with your function then you are effectively _over-writing_ your existing data with your new data and you cannot get it back without re-opening the original file again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have a decision that you can make: \n",
    "1. If you want to mutate the data in place then have your function return `None`. It will mutate your CTIFile in place and you do not need to return it.\n",
    "2. If you want your function to mutate a _copy_ of your original CTIFile dictionary (therefore leaving your original CTIFile dict untouched) then your function returns the _new_ CTIFile dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1 would look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_cti_data # This is my CTIFile dictionary\n",
    "update_factored_loads([[3000, 100, 100]], my_cti_data) # This function would return None so we do not assign the return value to a variable\n",
    "print(my_cti_data[\"[Factored Loads]\"]) # You would now see the updated load in the file data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2 would look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_cti_data # This is my CTIFile dictionary\n",
    "my_updated_cti_data = update_factored_loads([[3000, 100, 100]], my_cti_data) # This function returns a copy with updated info so assign the copy to a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# These two would now show different data\n",
    "print(my_updated_cti_data[\"[Factored Loads]\"])\n",
    "print(my_cti_data[\"[Factored Loads]\"]) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you make a copy in Python? You do so explicity by using `copy.deepcopy(obj)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "my_new_cti_data = copy.deepcopy(cti_data) # deepcopy copies the container (the dictionary) and every piece of data within it\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you are going with Option 2, perform your copy as the first line of your function and perform all of your operations on the copy. You _might_ also need to copy your `factored_loads` input, depending on how you assign your new loads to your CTIFile dictionary. Your function tests can help you troubleshoot this."
